#A-novel-adaptive-classification-and-recognitionn-system-for-ship-radiated-noise

To effectively classify ships, a novel adaptive classification and recognitionn system for ship radiated noise using modified singular spectrum decomposition (RICSSD), weighted fractional-order ensemble fluctuation dispersion entropy (WEFDEα) and improved support vector machine using snake optimization (SO-SVM) is proposed, named RICSSD-WEFDEα-SO-SVM.
